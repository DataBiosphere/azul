branches:
  # Disable branch builds except for the main branches. For PRs, only the `pr`
  # build will be performed, the `push` build won't. This means that PR authors
  # will not see builds for the head commit of their branches, only merge
  # commits of their branches into the target branch. Given the 50% reduction
  # of load on Travis this should be an acceptable compromise.

  # Travis already sets up a virtualenv (not using `python -m venv`, but `virtualenv`)
  - make requirements
  - pip install coveralls codecov

script:
  - set -e
  # Travis VM images contain a /etc/boto.cfg which ultimately causes moto to
  # look for the Python bindings for GCE. Setting BOTO_CONFIG overrides that.
  - export BOTO_CONFIG=/dev/null
  # Hack: The use of chrgp compensates for a quirk of Docker. The PyCharm image
  # used by make format sets up a user called `developer` and assigns it UID
  # 1000. Travis is running as UID 2000. An alternative would be to pass --user
  # to `docker run` and bind-mount an /etc/passwd that maps that to `developer`.
  # Currently I'm unclear why `make format` works unchanged on Docker
  - sudo chgrp -R 1000 . && make format && sudo chgrp -R $(id -g) .
