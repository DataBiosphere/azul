# Note that these are all regexes so if you don't use proper quoting/escaping
# you risk ignoring more secrets strings than you expect, or not ignoring
# the secret string you intend to ignore. After committing changes to this file
# you should run `make trufflehog` to ensure that none of the secrets in this
# file actually trigger Trufflehog. If they do, use [] around one of the
# characters in the ignored pattern in this file.

# This overrides one of the default patterns used by the AWS provider for
# `git secrets. We don't mind exposing account IDs.
