class InternMeta(type):
    """
    A meta class that interns instances of its instances such that the invariant (x == y) == (x is y) holds for all
    instances x and y of any instance of this meta class. Note that an instance of a metaclass is a class.

    This meta class does not consider thread safety. It should be as safe or unsafe as lru_cache from functools.

    Note also that this meta class never releases the memory used by instances of its instances.

    >>> class C(metaclass=InternMeta):
    ...     def __init__(self, x):
    ...         self.x = x

    >>> C(1) is C(1)
    True

    >>> C(1) is C(2)
    False

    Instances of an instance of this metaclass should be immutable.

    >>> from dataclasses import dataclass, field
    >>> @dataclass
    ... class D(metaclass=InternMeta):
    ...     x: int
    >>> d1, d2 = D(1), D(2)
    >>> d1 == d2
    False
    >>> d2.x = 1  # make them equal
    >>> d1 == d2
    True
    >>> d1 is d2  # but they are still not the same, violating the invariant.
    False

    Instances of an instance are interned based on the arguments they were constructed with. That means that instance
    equality must be consistent with the equality of the construction arguments. If it isn't i.e., if two instances
    are equal even if their construction arguments are not, the invariant will be violated.

    >>> @dataclass
    ... class E(metaclass=InternMeta):
    ...     x: int
    ...     y: int = field(compare=False)
    >>> e1, e2 = E(1, 1), E(1, 2)
    >>> e1.y == e2.y  # Even though .y is differs between instances â€¦
    False
    >>> e1 == e2  # they are considered equal because .y is insignificant for equality.
    True
    >>> e1 is e2  # Invariant is invalidated.
    False
