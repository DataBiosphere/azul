Upgrading
---------

This file documents any upgrade procedure that must be performed. Because we
don't use a semantic version, a change that requires explicit steps to upgrade
a is referenced by its Github issue number. After checking out a branch that
contains a commit resolving an issue listed here, the steps listed underneath
the issue need to be performed. When switching away from that branch, to a
branch that does not have the listed changes, the steps would need to be
reverted. This is all fairly informal and loosely defined. Hopefully we won't
have too many entries in this file.
