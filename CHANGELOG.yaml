  - title: Extract preservation_method instead of storage_method
    issues:
      - https://github.com/DataBiosphere/azul/issues/503
      - https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/data-browser/issues/308
    upgrade:
      - requirements
      - deploy
      - reindex
      - clients
    notes: The `hits[*].specimens.storageMethod` response field was renamed to `preservationMethod`, the corresponding
           facet was already called `preservationMethod` so no change was required there.

    upgrade:

      - requirements
