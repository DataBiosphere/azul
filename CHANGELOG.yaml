  - title:  Removed `disease` extraction from `donor_organism`

      - https://github.com/DataBiosphere/azul/issues/527
      - https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/data-browser/issues/335
    upgrade:
      - deploy
      - reindex

  - title: Proxy requests to DSS /files, enforcing Retry-After on browser's behalf
    issues:
      - https://github.com/DataBiosphere/azul/issues/531
      - https://github.com/humancellatlas/data-browser/issues/331
      - https://github.com/humancellatlas/data-browser/issues/342
    upgrade:
      - requirements
      - deploy
    notes: This adds a `/dss/files/{uuid}` endpoint and changes `/repository/files` so that its `hits[].files[].url`
           response field points to that new endpoint (it pointed directly to the DSS before this change). The new
           endpoint forwards the request to the DSS. When the DSS responds with a 30x status code and a `Retry-After`
           header, the service sleeps for a certain amount of time before forwarding the DSS response back to the
           client. Clients don't need to be updated as long as they use `hits[].files[].url` for direct downloads.

  - title: Extract preservation_method instead of storage_method
    issues:
      - https://github.com/DataBiosphere/azul/issues/503
      - https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/data-browser/issues/308
    upgrade:
      - requirements
      - deploy
      - reindex
      - clients
    notes: The `hits[*].specimens.storageMethod` response field was renamed to `preservationMethod`, the corresponding
           facet was already called `preservationMethod` so no change was required there.

  - title: Add CHANGELOG.yaml and expose the top ten entries via /version endpoint
    upgrade:
      - deploy
      - requirements
