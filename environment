    # The path to the project root directory
    AZUL_HOME

    # The name of the current deployment. This variable controls the name of all
    # cloud resources and is the main vehicle for isolating cloud resources
    # between deployments.
    AZUL_DEPLOYMENT_STAGE

    # The URL to the DSS (aka Blue box) REST API
    AZUL_DSS_ENDPOINT

    # The name of the hosted zone in Route 53 in which to create user friendly
    # domain names for various API gateways. This hosted zone will have to be
    # created manually prior to running `make terraform`. The value is typically
    # not deployment specific. A subdomain will automatically be created for
    # each deployment.
    AZUL_DOMAIN_NAME

    # A template for the name of the Route 53 record set in the hosted zone
    # specified by AZUL_DOMAIN_NAME. The string {lambda_name} in the template
    # will be substituted with the name of the Lambda function, e.g. `indexer`
    # or `service`. May contain periods.
    AZUL_SUBDOMAIN_TEMPLATE

    # A prefix to be prepended to the names of AWS Lambda functions and
    # associated resources. Must not contain periods.
    AZUL_RESOURCE_PREFIX

    # The host and port of the Elasticsearch instance to use. This takes
    # precedence over AZUL_ES_DOMAIN.
    AZUL_ES_ENDPOINT

    # The name of the AWS-hosted Elasticsearch instance (not a domain name) to
    # use. The given ES domain's endpoint will be looked up dynamically.
    AZUL_ES_DOMAIN

    # Boolean value, 1 to share `dev` ES domain, 0 (default) to create your own
    AZUL_SHARE_ES_DOMAIN

    # Prefix to describe ES indices
    AZUL_INDEX_PREFIX

    # The number of nodes in the AWS-hosted Elasticsearch cluster
    AZUL_ES_INSTANCE_COUNT

    # The EC2 instance type to use for a cluster node
    AZUL_ES_INSTANCE_TYPE

    # The size of the EBS volume backing each cluster node
    AZUL_ES_VOLUME_SIZE

    # Elasticsearch operation timeout in seconds
    AZUL_ES_TIMEOUT

    # The name of the bucket where TerraForm maintains its state, allowing
    # multiple developers to collaboratively use TerraForm in a single AWS
    # account. This bucket is likely going be shared with other projects such as
    # DSS and might require some coordination with the developers of those
    # projects. The special string {account_id} is replaced with the ID of the
    # AWS account the currently configured AWS credentials belong to.
    AZUL_TERRAFORM_BACKEND_BUCKET_TEMPLATE

    # The number of workers pulling files from DSS. There is one such set of DSS
    # workers per index worker!
    AZUL_DSS_WORKERS

    # Whether to create a subscription to DSS during deployment. Set this
    # variable to 1 to enable `make deploy` to subscribe the indexer in the
    # active deployment to DSS bundle events. Making a subscription requires
    # authenticating against DSS using a Google service account specific to this
    # deployment.
    #
    # If making the subscription is enabled, `make terraform` will automatically
    # set up the Google service account for the indexer and deposit its
    # credentials into AWS secrets manager. For this to work you need to
    # configure your *personal* service account credentials in
    # `environment.local` enabling Terraform to create the shared *indexer*
    # service account. The two variables that need to be set are
    # GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and GOOGLE_PROJECT. These are well
    # documented. You need to use service account credentials, `gcloud auth
    # login` apparently does not work for this.
    #
    # Set this variable to 0 to prevent the registration of a subscription and
    # to disable the creation of the Google service account. You won't need to
    # configure any Google credentials in that case. Note that disabling the
    # subscription registration won't remove any existing subscriptions. Use
    # `scripts/subscribe.py -U` for that.
    #
    # If you set this variable back from 1 to 0 on an existing deployment, be
    # sure to run `make terraform` right afterwards so the Google cloud
    # resources are physically deleted. After that you may also unset the
    # GOOGLE_.. variables in your environment.
    AZUL_SUBSCRIBE_TO_DSS

    # The number of concurrently running indexer lambda executions. Chalice
    # creates one Lambda function for handling HTTP requests from API Gateway
    # and one additional Lambda function per event handler. The concurrency
    # limit applies to each such function independently. See
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html
    # for details. This setting may also be used to drive other scaling choices,
    # like the number of shards in Elasticsearch.
