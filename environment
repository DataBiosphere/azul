    # The name of the hosted zone in Route 53 in which to create user friendly
    # domain names for various API gateways. This hosted zone will have to be

    # A template for the name of the Route 53 record set in the hosted zone
    # specified by AZUL_DOMAIN_NAME. The string {lambda_name} in the template
    # will be substituted with the name of the Lambda function, e.g. `indexer`

    # The name of the bucket where TerraForm maintains its state, allowing

    # account. This bucket is likely going be shared with other projects such as
    # DSS and might require some coordination with the developers of those

    # Whether to create a subscription to DSS during deployment. Set this
    # variable to 1 to enable `make deploy` to subscribe the indexer in the
    # active deployment to DSS bundle events. Making a subscription requires
    # authenticating against DSS using a Google service account specific to this
    # deployment.
    #
    # If making the subscription is enabled, `make terraform` will automatically
    # set up the Google service account for the indexer and deposit its
    # credentials into AWS secrets manager. For this to work you need to
    # configure your *personal* service account credentials in
    # `environment.local` enabling Terraform to create the shared *indexer*
    # service account. The two variables that need to be set are
    # GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and GOOGLE_PROJECT. These are well
    # documented. You need to use service account credentials, `gcloud auth
    # login` apparently does not work for this.
    #
    # Set this variable to 0 to prevent the registration of a subscription and
    # to disable the creation of the Google service account. You won't need to
    # configure any Google credentials in that case. Note that disabling the
    # subscription registration won't remove any existing subscriptions. Use
    # `scripts/subscribe.py -U` for that.
