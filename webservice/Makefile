# Sample usage
# make testme -- Run tests using chalice in localmode against an ES instance as defined in docker-compose.yml
#
# make travistest -- Run tests using chalice in localmode against an ES instance residing on the docker host, as defined in docker-compose-hostnetworking.yml

# make -- Run using chalice in localmode against an ES instance as defined in docker-compose.yml.  No test data will be populated.
