    # GitHub Actions' `cron` uses UTC, which, given daylight savings time, is
    # pretty useless if one wants a consistent local starting time. Instead,
    # we'll just run a Python script every hour and implement the schedule in
    # that script. This also allows for things that aren't possible with a
    # `cron` expression, like biweekly intervals.
    #
    # Additionally, GitHub documents that scheduled events can be delayed during
    # periods of high load, or even skipped. To reduce the chances of these
    # restrictions impacting our schedule, we run the script more than once per
    # hour.
