The other Markdown files in this directory each represent a GitHub *saved
reply*, i.e., a template for comments to GitHub issues and pull requests. There
is an outstanding [request][1] to add the ability for teams to track saved
replies as source code in their repositories. Until that feature is available,
each user has to manually add each of the saved replies in this folder to their
GitHub account settings, as described in the [GitHub documentation][2].
