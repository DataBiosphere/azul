class ResponsesHelper:
    """
    Work around the lack of reentrance in the `responses` library. Both `moto` and `responses` suffer from an
    inherent design flaw: they use unittest.mock.patch which is global but their decorators and context managers
    pretend to be reentrant. It is essentially impossible to nest a RequestMock CM inside another one, or in a method
    decorated with @responses.activate or one of the moto decorators. Furthermore, one can't combine
    @responses.activate with any of the moto decorators. Use this method in tests as follows:

    >>> import moto
    >>> import requests
    >>> @moto.mock_sts
    ... def test_foo():
    ...     with ResponsesHelper() as helper:
    ...         helper.add(responses.Response(method=responses.GET,
    ...                                       url='http://foo.bar/blah',
    ...                                       body='Duh!'))
    ...         helper.add_passthru('http://localhost:12345/')
    ...         assert requests.get('http://foo.bar/blah').content == b'Duh!'
    >>> test_foo()

    In other words, whenever you would call the global responses.add() or responses.add_passthru() functions,
    call the helper's method of the same name instead. The helper will remove the mock response upon exit and restore
    the set pf pass-throughs to their original value, essentially undoiing all .add() and .add_passthru() invocations.

    Remember that you do not need @responses.activate if one of the moto decorators is present since they already
    activate responses.
