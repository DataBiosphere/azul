    Returns a dictionary that maps environment variable names to values. The 
    values are either None or strings. String values can contain references to 
    other environment variables in the form `{FOO}` where FOO is the name of an 
    environment variable. See 

    https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/string.html#format-string-syntax

    for the concrete syntax. These references will be resolved *after* the
    overall environment has been compiled by merging all relevant
    `environment.py` and `environment.local.py` files.

    Entries with a `None` value will be excluded from the environment. They
    can be used to document a variable without a default value in which case
    other, more specific `environment.py` or `environment.local.py` files must
    provide the value.
