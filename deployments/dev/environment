# Set variables for the `dev` (short for development) deployment here.
#
# To define an AZUL_â€¦ variable use `_set AZUL_FOO bar`. For all other
# variables use `export BAR=baz`.
#
# Only modify this file if you intend to commit those changes. To change the
# environment with a setting that's specific to you AND the deployment, create
# a environment.local right next to this file and make your changes there. In
# that file the same rules apply with regard to `_set` vs `export`. Settings
# applicable to all environments but specific to you go into environment.local
# at the project root.

# FIXME: this should probably be pointing at integration
